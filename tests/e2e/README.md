# Clavix E2E

End-to-end tests driving the native Tauri binary via `tauri-driver` +
`WebdriverIO`. Runs on Linux only — `tauri-driver` relies on
WebKitGTK's `WebKitWebDriver`, which has no macOS/Windows counterpart.

## One-time setup

System packages:

```bash
sudo apt install webkit2gtk-driver xvfb
```

Rust & JS tooling:

```bash
cargo install tauri-driver --locked
pnpm install
```

## Running locally

Build the app in debug mode, then run the suite:

```bash
pnpm tauri build --debug
pnpm test:e2e
```

Headless (CI-style):

```bash
xvfb-run -a pnpm test:e2e
```

Running `pnpm test:e2e` assumes the Tauri binary already exists at
`src-tauri/target/debug/clavix`. The WebdriverIO config errors out early
if the binary or `tauri-driver` is missing, with a hint.

## Specs

The suite is driven by a seeded Vaultwarden instance (Docker, port
`8765`) brought up automatically by `tests/e2e/wdio.conf.mjs` via
`docker compose`. `src-tauri/examples/e2e_seed.rs` registers two test
users and seeds a canonical fixture set:

- **Primary account** (`E2E_EMAIL`, no 2FA): one cipher of each type
  (Login, SecureNote, Card, Identity, SSH key), a TOTP-enabled login,
  a personal folder with a cipher inside, and an organization with two
  collections plus one org-scoped cipher.
- **Secondary account** (`e2e-2fa@clavix.test`, password
  `two-factor-fixture`): TOTP 2FA pre-enabled against the deterministic
  secret `JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXPJBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP`. Specs that exercise the
  2FA login flow can recompute valid codes from this constant via
  RFC 6238. One fixture cipher ("Behind 2FA") is seeded so sync is
  visible.

All seeding goes through the app's own crypto path (`build_cipher_body`)
so a regression in production code surfaces here before it reaches the
UI tests.

| Spec                  | What it covers                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `smoke.spec.mjs`      | Pipeline sanity — binary launches, webview renders           |
| `login.spec.mjs`      | Onboarding → login → auto-sync shows seeded ciphers          |
| `create-cipher.spec.mjs` | `＋` → fill editor → save → new item in list             |
| `share-cipher.spec.mjs`  | Personal cipher → org collection via `share_cipher_to_collection` IPC |
| `lock-unlock.spec.mjs`   | Lock → unlock round-trip restores the vault              |
| `auto-lock.spec.mjs`     | Idle window elapses → `UnlockForm` reappears             |

Two env vars to iterate locally without recycling Docker each run:

- `E2E_SKIP_DOCKER=1` — reuse an externally-managed container
- `E2E_KEEP_CONTAINER=1` — don't tear down after the suite (useful for
  inspecting Vaultwarden logs)

## Known gotchas

- `WebKitWebDriver` binds IPv6 (`::1`) by default, which breaks on IPv4-only
  environments. `wdio.conf.mjs` passes `--native-host 127.0.0.1` to
  sidestep this ([tauri-apps/tauri#3815]).
- GPU compositing in WebKitGTK misbehaves under WebDriver sessions. We
  export `WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1` to force the CPU path.
- WebdriverIO v8+ has reported regressions with `tauri-driver` — we pin
  to v7. If you update, re-run the smoke before touching anything else.
- Tauri `withGlobalTauri=true` is intentional: the share-cipher spec
  drives `window.__TAURI__.core.invoke` directly to bypass the flaky
  drag-drop UI. The drag logic itself is covered by `drag.test.ts` on
  the vitest side.
- The Tauri app's data dir is sandboxed to `tests/e2e/sandbox/` via
  `XDG_DATA_HOME` so runs never touch the real `~/.local/share/clavix/`.
